# primageneratorx
Creates primagen characters using a base

Modes:

-True random: 
uses actual random colour values, normally produces nasty results

-Nice random: 
uses a random base colour but then attempts to make colours around the base that will look pleasing together
normally creates fairly nice results

-Colour wheel mode: 
uses a colour wheel to pick what a base colour and a selection of random colours from around the base one
then also takes a colour from the opposite side to use as a highlight
produces the best and most cusotmisable results
